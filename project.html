    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>The chosen solution for the arch gravity dam in Wadi Ferran, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt combines various design elements that address the specific requirements of the project. The selection process was guided by careful consideration of several key factors to ensure the effectiveness and environmental compatibility of the dam.</p>
  
    <h2>Design Considerations</h2>
    <h3>Preservation of the Natural Environment</h3>
    <p>One of the primary factors considered during the design process was the preservation of the natural environment. Recognizing the importance of ecological conservation, the integration of bi wings into the dam design was implemented. This innovative approach allows the dam to seamlessly blend with the surrounding landscape. The bi wings are carefully immersed into the virgin rocks of the mountain, with one pair of wings vertically submerged and the other pair gradually merging with the mountain rocks. By adopting this design approach, the dam becomes a harmonious part of the natural environment, minimizing its impact on the local wildlife and ecosystem.</p>
  
    <h3>Provision of Clean Drinking Water</h3>
    <p>The provision of clean drinking water to the local community was another crucial aspect considered in the design. The inclusion of a reliable water filtration system was essential to ensure that the stored water is safe for consumption. Osmotic pumps with a filtration system integrated into the intake gates were incorporated into the design to effectively remove impurities from the water. This filtration system utilizes natural materials such as veteran grass, sand, gravel, and soil, which act as effective filters, purifying the water and making it suitable for drinking.</p>
  
    <h3>Flood Management</h3>
    <p>Flood management was also given significant attention in the dam's design. To address this concern, spillway gates were strategically positioned at the top of the dam. These gates serve as controlled outlets for excess water during periods of heavy rainfall or floods. By diverting the excess water through the spillway gates, the dam prevents overtopping and potential damage to the structure.</p>
  
    <h3>Maximizing Utilization of Water Resources</h3>
    <p>Maximizing the utilization of water resources was another important consideration in the design. The inclusion of control gates allows for precise control of water release from the dam. These gates, which are mainly plastic curved gates with rods, provide flexibility in the utilization of the water control system without the need for highly advanced or energy-intensive mechanisms. The water released through these gates is directed into specifically designed canals, which are dedicated to the irrigation of moringa farms. This dual-purpose approach ensures that the dam not only provides water storage but also supports agricultural development in the region.</p>
  
    <h2>Prototype Selection</h2>
    <p>The prototype chosen for the arch gravity dam project in Wadi Ferran, Sinai Peninsula, Egypt was designed to closely mimic the final construction of the dam. Special attention was given to selecting materials that meet the design requirements and constraints.</p>
  
    <p>During the prototype construction, a combination of materials was carefully chosen to reflect the sustainable construction practices that will be employed in thefinal dam. Construction waste materials like Portland cement, polyester, and dried Eichhornia were incorporated into the prototype. These materials were selected for their structural strength and their ability to effectively use recycled resources.</p>
  
    <p>The gates of the prototype are made from durable plastic to ensure both strength and ease of operation. These plastic gates mimic the functionality and performance of the final gates, providing an accurate representation of their intended design.</p>
